Things to note for server:
1. Make sure the cronFunc function is not commented out
2. API_keys have to be hardcoded for now as the terminal is not able to read from the .env file
3. MongoDb server needs to be hardcoded for same issue with .env file
4. Make sure to not listen on the port with the server, blockout that code

To clear log files for PM2 run these two scripts:
1. clearOutputLogsPM2
2. clearErrorLogsPM2
